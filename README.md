# Overview


This is an implementation of the classic [2048 game](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) using the good old Turbo C and Borland Graphics. Compiling the project could be a challenge as it requires Borland C and [`graphics.h`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface), which no one has used in the last decade ðŸ¥². However, use [Turbo C++](https://www.fileeagle.com/software/1362/Turbo-C) if you're really curious.
